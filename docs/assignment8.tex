EOSC 511/ATSC 506: 

 Note, the given input parameters may be inappropriate.  In particular
a maximum iteration number of 10 is too small.  Make sure your
relaxation scheme is converging.

Problem numbers below refer to the problems in the lab text itself.



\begin{enumerate}
\item Do FIRST this subset of problem 3.  Compare the efficiency of the 
SOR method and the Jacobi iteration. 

\item Then using the more efficient scheme, 
choose one parameter of the problem
(eg depth, width of ocean, vertical viscosity, wind stress, latitude)
vary it (3 or 4 choices) and compare the solutions.

\item Then using the most efficient scheme, attack this subset of problem 2.  
Choosing one of 5.16/5.17/5.18 compare the stability of the code to that of the
Arakawa Jacobian.  Note, as you are looking for nonlinear instability
it will occur faster if you make the wind speed higher (say by a factor
of 10).
