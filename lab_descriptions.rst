Lab/course information
======================


Lab 1: Introduction to Numerical Methods
________________________________________

* To run the executable IPython notebook, open a terminal window, change to the
  folder containing your cloned numeric repository and cd to the lab1 folder. Then
  start IPython by typing::

    ipython notebook Lab_1.ipynb

  This will launch your browser with the notebook as demonstrated in class. 

* If you want to read the lab offline, here are:

  * `An html copy of the IPython notebook <html_files/Lab_1.html>`_

  * `A pdf copy of the   IPython notebook  <pdf_files/Lab_1.pdf>`_

* After you have gone through the lab, answer the following questions:

  * :ref:`assign1`

Lab 2: Stability and accuracy
_____________________________


* The notebook is checked into git at `lab2.ipynb <https://github.com/phaustin/numeric/tree/master/lab2/lab2.ipynb>`_
  Change to your cloned numeric folder and type "git pull" in a command window to update
  your repository and fetch it

* If you want to read the lab offline, here are:

  * `An html copy of the IPython notebook <html_files/lab2.html>`_

  * `A pdf copy of the   IPython notebook  <pdf_files/lab2.pdf>`_

* Assignment:  both graduate students and undergraduates should do all five problems
  (Error, Accuracy, Stability, Backward-Euler, Taylor).   Email paustin@eos.ubc.ca
  with a url pointing to the notebook containing your answers for the programming questions.
  The deriviations can be done as a scanned pdf or as plain paper or a pdf file.
